## Plan for the day
- [x] Finish Lesson 12a (Advanced Functions)
 


## To investigate

## Learned today
- Anonymous functions are functions that do not have a name. Instead of being defined with the *'function keyword'* followed by an *'identifier'* (the function name), they are created on the fly and usually used in situations where a function is required **temporarily**, such as arguments to other functions or in expressions.
  
- Anonymous functions are commonly used in scenarios like:
  * Passing functions as arguments
  * Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)
  * Asynchronous code and callbacks
    
- Another way to create anonymous functions in JavaScript, is the ***Arrow Function***
  > let add = (x, y) => x + y;
  
- Asynchronous codes refers to codes that operates independently of the main program flow. Instead of executing line by line, asynchronous code allows certain operations to be deferred, executed later, or run in the background. This is particularly important when dealing with tasks that may take some time to complete, such as fetching data from a server, reading a file, or handling user input.

- Types of Asynchronous functions:
  * .setTimeout() - This will run a function after a given time
  * .setInterval() - This will keep running a function continuously within a given time interval
 
- **.forEach()** is often preferred over the traditional **For loop** for iterating through arrays due to its cleaner and more expressive syntax, improved readability, avoidance of off-by-one errors, and automatic handling of loop counters.

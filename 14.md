# Codelog #14 - 11/01/2024



## Plan for the day
- [x] Start the Udemy Course
 


## To investigate
- [] what is closure in javascript
- [x] Explore the implementation of a loader animation



## Learned today
- I learnt how to populate the text content of the elements using JavaScript. JavaScript's **document.getElementById** is used to target HTML elements by their IDs, this is similar with **document.querySelector** only that this works with a class element.
  
## Syntax
    <!-- The overall container -->
    <div class="quote-container" id="quote-container">
      <!-- Quote -->
      <div class="quote-text">
        <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i>
        <span id="quote"></span>
      </div>

- I learnt how to fetch quotes from an external API and demonstrate fetching quotes locally for customization by implementing a JavaScript function using asynchronous fetch to get quotes from the API and used the Math.random() function to dynamically select a random quote from the fetched array.
- 
## Syntax
    // Get Quotes from API
    async function getQuotes() {
      const apiUrl = 'https://jacintodesign.github.io/quotes-api/data/quotes.json';
      try {
        const response = await fetch(apiUrl);
        apiQuotes = await response.json();
        newQuotes();
      } catch (error) {
        // catch error here
      }
    }

   
- I learnt about conditional styling based on the length of the quote text, adjusting font size for better presentation, The length of the quote text is checked, and the appropriate class is added or removed based on the condition.
 
- Additional, I learnt how to introduce functionality to tweet quotes on Twitter, add icons as HTML lines of code using the link element


## Done Today

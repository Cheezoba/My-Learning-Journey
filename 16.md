# Codelog #15 - 22/03/2024


## To investigate
- Start Next project (Navigation Notion)



## Learned today
- I learnt about CSS custom properties (variables), which are like style libraries for styling elements on a website. Instead of repeating the same styles over and over again, I used variables to store colors, fonts, spacing, and other design values. This made my CSS code cleaner, easier to manage, and more flexible. One key concept I learned is using the **:root** selector to declare global variables that can be accessed throughout the entire stylesheet. For example, I can define a --primary-color variable for the main color theme and use it across multiple elements by simply referencing the variable name.

> - **:root** is used to define global CSS variables.
> - Variables are declared using --variable-name: value; syntax.
> - Variables can be used with the var(--variable-name) function to apply the stored value to CSS properties.
> - Custom properties are utilized for defining colors, font family, spacing units, etc., and then applied throughout the stylesheet for 
    consistent styling.

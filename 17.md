## Learned today
- Today I ran into an error ***Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'textContent')*** and after searching and looking for the error in my code for hours ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ I figured it was due to the variable not being correctly selected. In my code, the variable was selected using ***document.querySelector('span')***, which selects the first <span> element in the document. However, I had more than one <span> element in my HTML. So when trying to select multiple <span> elements, use ***document.querySelectorAll('span')*** instead. This will return a NodeList containing all the <span> elements, and I can then access each element by index.

## Plan for the day
- [] Finish Lesson 11 ( Arrays and Loops)
- [] Investigate what is Do-while loop and what it's used for?
 


## To investigate
- Generating HTML using JavaScript


## Learned today
- **Accumulator Pattern** is when collective result of values are been accmulated into a variable depending on the problem you intend to solve. such as
  * Numeric Values (Summation)
  * Arrays (Concatenation)
  * Objects (Merging)
  * Boolean Values (Logical Operations)
- Do while-loop statements are executed atleast once before checking the condition. It is used when you want to ensure that a block of code is executed atleast once, regardless of whether the loop condition is true or false.

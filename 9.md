# Codelog #9 - 19/12/2023



## Plan for the day
- [x] Finish Lesson 11 ( Arrays and Loops)
- [x] Investigate what is Do-while loop and what it's used for?
 


## To investigate
- Generating HTML using JavaScript


## Learned today
- **Accumulator Pattern** is when collective result of values are been accmulated into a variable depending on the problem you intend to solve. such as
  * Numeric Values (Summation)
  * Arrays (Concatenation)
  * Objects (Merging)
  * Boolean Values (Logical Operations)

   
- Do while-loop is used when you want to ensure that a block of code is executed atleast once, regardless of whether the loop condition is true or false.
- How a Do-while loop works;
  * After the code block is executed, the condition is evaluated.
  * If the condition is true, the loop continues, and the code block is executed again.
  * If the condition is false, the loop terminates, and the program moves to the next statement after the do-while loop.

  
  > syntax
  >> let i = 0;

  >> do {
     i++;
    } while (i < 5);
   

- Do-while loops are used in;
   * Game development or simulations
   * When building menu-driven programs
   * User Input Validation



## Done Today
- Finish Lesson 11 ( Arrays and Loops)
- Investigated what is Do-while loop and what it's used for



## Plan for tomorrow
- Review Lesson 11 ( Arrays and Loops)

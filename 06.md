# Codelog #6 - 08/12/2023



## Plan for the day
- [x] Finish Lesson 9 (Document Object Model (DOM))
- [x] Look up APIs, Event Listeners, and Type Coercion
 


## To investigate



## Learned today
- Application Programming Interface (API) basically connects apps together. In other words, there are like figma plugins because of the idea of extending functionality and enabling interactions within a software environment.
- Type coercion occurs when JavaScript automatically converts a value from one type to another, typically during operations like comparisons or arithmetic. There are two types of type coercion in JavaScript: ***implicit coercion and explicit coercion***.



## Done Today
- Finish Lesson 9 (Document Object Model (DOM))



## Plan for tomorrow

## Learned today
- The **form** HTML element represents a document section containing interactive controls for submitting information.
>           <form id="bookmark-form">
            <!-- Website Name -->
            <div class="form-group">
              <label for="website-name" class="form-label">Website Name</label>
              <input type="text" class="form-input" id="website-name" />
            </div>

            <!-- Website URL -->
            <div class="form-group">
              <label for="website-url" class="form-label">Website URL</label>
              <input type="text" class="form-input" id="website-url" />
            </div>
            <button type="submit">save</button>
          </form>

- the submit event fires on the **form** element itself, and not on any **button** or **input type="submit"** inside it.

- The submit event fires when:
> + the user clicks a submit button,
> + the user presses Enter while editing a field (e.g. **input type="text"**) in a form,
> + a script calls the form.requestSubmit() method

- Use the event name in methods like addEventListener(), or set an event handler property.
>  addEventListener("submit", (event) => {});
>  onsubmit = (event) => {};

- The change event is fired for **input**, **select**, and **textarea** elements when the user modifies the element's value.

-the change event fires at a different moment:

> + When a **input type="checkbox"** element is checked or unchecked (by clicking or using the   keyboard)

> + When a **input type="radio"** element is checked (but not when unchecked)

> + When the user commits the change explicitly (e.g., by selecting a value from a **select**'s dropdown with a mouse click, by selecting a date from a date picker for **input type="date"**, by selecting a file in the file picker for **input type="file"**, etc.)

> + When the element loses focus after its value was changed: for elements where the user's interaction is typing rather than selection, such as a **textarea** or the text, search, url, tel, email, or password types of the **input** element.

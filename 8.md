# Codelog #8 - 18/12/2023



## Plan for the day
- [] Start Lesson 11 ( Arrays and Loops)
 


## To investigate



## Learned today
- Arrays are values grouped together in a square bracket ([ ]), they are also obejects which means they have properties and methods. They can contain; Numbers, Strings, Objects and even Arrays as values
 > Examples [1, "Chizoba", false, { name: "socks" }, [20, 25]]

- Arrays have properties and methods and these are a few examples I learnt today;
  * .Length - Determines the total number of values in an array.
  * .Push - Adds new values into an array.
  * .Splash - Removes values in an array.

- A loop basically execute a block of code repeatedly, it consists of a loop variable, loop condition and the increment step. There are 3 types of loop conditions; 
  * While Loop
  * For Loop
  * Do-while Loop
 
- **For loops** are used in standard loops, *i.e when the number of iterations are known* . **While Loops** are used in a Non - standard loop, *i.e when the number of iterations are not known* .

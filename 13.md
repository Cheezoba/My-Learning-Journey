## To investigate
-  


## Learned today
- Arrow functions is a cleaner way to write regular functions in JavaScript. They mostly work like regular function but are not advisable to use when you plan on hoisting a function.
  
## Syntax
---
      const oneParam = (param) => {
        console.log(param + 1);
      };

      oneParam(6);

      //or using the one line arrow method

      const oneParam2 = (param) => console.log(param + 1);
      oneParam2(6);

- The **.addEventListener()** method is versatile and allows you to handle various types of events on different HTML elements. it can also run multiple listeners to one event. The *.addEventListener()* consist of the event and the function you want to add, and can remove any of the event using the **.removeEvenListener()** method
  
## Syntax
---
      const buttonElement = document.querySelector(".js-button");
      buttonElement.addEventListener("click", () => {
        console.log("Click");
      });

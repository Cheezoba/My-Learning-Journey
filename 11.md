# Codelog #11 - 30/12/2023



## Plan for the day
- [x] Continue writing down everything I've learnt about Lesson 11a and 11b (Arrays and Loops)
- [x] Continue Lesson 12a (Advanced Functions)
 


## To investigate
-  


## Learned today
- More Array Methods;
  * .sort() - arranges an array alphabetically.
  * .reverse() - arranges the elements in an array from right to left.

- For...in loops is used to iterate over the enumerable properties of an object. It's particularly useful for iterating over the keys or indices of an object, such as the properties of an array or the keys of an object literal. 

## Example
  ---
      let person = {
        name: "John",
        age: 30,
        city: "New York",
      };

      for (let key in person) {
        console.log(key + ": " + person[key]);
      }

- For...of loops provides a concise and readable way to iterate over the values of iterable objects, such as arrays, strings and more.

## Example
---
      let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];

      for (let fruit of fruits) {
        console.log(fruit);
      }



## Done Today
- Finished writing down everything I've learnt about Lesson 11a and 11b (Arrays and Loops)



## Plan for tomorrow
- Finish Lesson 12a (Advanced Functions)

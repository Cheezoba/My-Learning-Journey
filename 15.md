# Codelog #15 - 19/03/2024


## To investigate
- More Frameworks and Libraries 



## Learned today
- I discovered Tailwind CSS Framework, a handy tool for styling websites. Instead of writing long blocks of code, I used short commands like **bg-blue-500** for colors and **md:flex** for making responsive designs. Tailwind also gave me options to customize colors and spacing, making my websites look polished and professional. It's like having a toolbox full of shortcuts that make web design easier and more efficient.
  
- I learned how to integrate scroll-triggered animations into my web projects using the Animate on Scroll (AOS) library. AOS provides easy-to-use tools for adding animations that activate as users scroll through the page. By applying AOS classes to HTML elements, I was able to create captivating scroll effects such as **fade-ins, slide-ups, and zoom-ins**. This library simplified the process of adding dynamic animations to my project, enhancing the overall user experience without needing complex JavaScript coding.

## Done Today
-  I built a Dynamic Landing Page with Scroll Animations using Tailwind CSS framework's templates.



## Plan for tomorrow
- Move the Next Project (Navigation Notion)
- Discovery More Frameworks and Libraries

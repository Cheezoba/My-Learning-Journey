# Codelog #2 - 04/12/2023


## Plan for the day
- [] Start Lesson 8 (Objects in JS)


## To investigate
- Other properties and methods provided by the localStorage object


## Learned today
- Objects can contain;
  * Functions
  * Nested Objects
  * 

- Objects can be written in two notations
  * Dot Notation (Default way)
  * Bracket Notation 

- Bracket notations are used for properties that don't work using the dot notation. E.g; 
  > const product2 = {
  ['delivery-time']: '1 day'
  console.log(product2['delivery-time']);
}

- JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) built-in objects
  > * *JSON.stringify* - converts JavaScript Objects into JSON
  > * *JSON.parse* - converts JSON into JavaScript Objects

- localStorage built-in objects
  > The data will not get deleted even if the browser is closed or even OS reboot and will be available until we manually clear the Local Storage of our Browser.
  > * localStorage.setItem( key , value ): stores key/value pair
  > * localStorage.getItem( key ): returns the value in front of key
